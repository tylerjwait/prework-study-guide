# Prework-Study-Guide Webpage

## A brief rundown  of the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. I wanted to make this to allow future students to review and get a starting point for the bootcamp. This study guide will provide relevant framework for any beginner to web development. I gained extensive knowledge in HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript while making this study guide.

## Usage

While on the webpage if you navigate each text box you will learn a little bit about each topic. Additionally if you use the following key command "command-option-I" in your web browser you will open the 'Dev-Tools' which will add another layer of knowledge for the study guide especially to better understand the JavaScript portion.
